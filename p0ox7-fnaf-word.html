My part: Mysterious voice: In the beginning there was darkness, nothing to se over a vast wasteland. suddenly a light, a giant light. it didn‚Äôt take for god to create us, but one thing was planned from the beginning. suddenly a light appears with giant letters spelling FNAF WORD Mysterious voice: And this, this is a story, a special story, OUR STORY!!! c√°mara pans down revealing a planet everything turns 8-bit Mysterious voice: It all started a couple of years back, 40 years. M‚Äôkay, so first Chipper builds a Lumberbot 6.0 that gained sentience. Said robot killed the dad and buried him with a shovel. Lumberbot 6.0 still cared for ‚Äúhis‚Äù son, but that afternoon he shoved Chippers wife into a pie he had ordered to be big enough to fit in. After she was baked to death, he ate her inside the pie, took her, hollowed out her insides and stuffed her in the corner while she still smiled. Tykes brother had died at some point(probably an axe) as Lumberbot blamed. https://twitter.com/nefarious\_skull/status/1126274601250578434 (https://twitter.com/nefarious_skull/status/1126274601250578434) Bones, the artist formerly known as Rebornica, asked if Fans could potentially put their response to certain things said about them in the replies of the callout- however, knowing how Reddit works, it seems unlikely that would get anyone really noticing what they've said. The first tweet of their response also links to another thread with even MORE clarification. Guys where i can do download the Fnaf World ?

Hey guys, after all the hype of the new VR game, I couldn't help but just watch Markiplier play FNAF SL Custom Night once more. Yenndo, being one of the ten animatronics (which for FNAF is actually quite a few, especially considering Scott could've picked any other animatronic), raises some questions. Now I know this wouldn't be interesting if he weren't canon, but in fact, he has a small chance of appearing in Funtime Auditorium which supposedly does make him canon. amp#x200B; Here's 1.
